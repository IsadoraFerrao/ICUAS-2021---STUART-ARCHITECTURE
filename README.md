# ICUAS-2021---Stuart-architecture

Specific objective
The aim of this project was to advance the state of the art through the definition and development of a resilient architecture for unmanned aerial vehicles that dynamically manages the network, even when subjected to an attack during a mission, integrating security methods and safety.

Problem's introduction 
The growing demand for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) has the potential to increase productivity and economy in the industry, due to its use in various fields, such as health, security, aerial photography, surveillance, military missions, agriculture, etc. The production and use of the UAV have increased lately, and there is a demand for the improvement of decision-making, security, safety, and knowledge about relevant technologies. Thus, these vehicles must continually adapt to complex missions where they face unpredictable issues. In this context, the aim of this paper is to advance the state of the art through the definition and development of a resilient architecture for UAV that dynamically manages the network, even when subjected to an attack during a mission, integrating security methods and safety. The architecture will be composed by three modules: (1) decision-making module, (2) diagnosis module, and (3) resilient module. This work also investigates the incorporation of safety and security as a unified concept in the development of UAV.
